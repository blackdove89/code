 the original spProcessReissueCases procedure is NOT meant to log CaseId errors.
because it is a Batch Processing Procedure

spProcessReissueCases is designed to process multiple cases at once
It generates one data file containing many cases
It's a system-level operation, not case-specific

Error Types It Should Log:

 NOT individual case data errors
File system errors (can't create directories, can't write files)
Configuration errors (missing settings)
Email system errors (can't send notifications)
FTP errors (can't send file to mainframe)
Database connection errors Permission errors

Where Case-Specific Errors Should Be Logged:
In the Sub-Procedures:

spGenerateReissueData - should log individual case processing errors
spCalcGrossToNet_main - logs case-specific calculation errors
Other case-processing procedures

Example Error Flow:
spProcessReissueCases (System errors: CaseId = NULL)
  └── calls spGenerateReissueData (Case errors: CaseId = 12345)
      └── calls spCalcGrossToNet_main (Case errors: CaseId = 12345)
